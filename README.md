# Home_Sales

This is my submission for Module 22 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

Running `Home_sales_colab.ipynb` will give you a notebook that uses spark and sql to display some data from `home_sales_revised.csv`. It also displayes the difference in runtime bewteen using sql to pull data from a table vs a cached table vs a partitioned table.
